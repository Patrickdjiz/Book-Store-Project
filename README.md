# Book-Store-Project

This project utilises the MERN stack (mongodb, express, react, node.js) to create a library web application that can create, delete, update, and get library books. 

Frontend:
I am using Vite as my React project template. It is a platform-asgnostic frontend tool for building web applications quickly
This project uses Tailwind CSS to speed up the development process as it comes with a design system that helps maintain consistency across various design requirements
